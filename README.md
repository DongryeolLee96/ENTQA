# Dataset
## Data Description
  Each data point in our dataset is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:
```
  "question": The question asked in the Open-QA task.
  "golden_answer": The gold standard answers to the question (provided in list). 
  "answer_fid", "answer_gpt35", "answer_chatgpt", "answer_gpt4", "answer_newbing": The answers generated by different models (FiD, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, and New Bing, respectively).
  "judge_fid", "judge_gpt35", "judge_chatgpt", "judge_gpt4", "judge_newbing": Boolean values indicating whether the corresponding model's answer was judged to be correct or incorrect (True for correct, False for incorrect) by human.
  "ans_type": Entity type of golden answer. We utilize Spacy's NER to classify each answer-set into 19 categories.
  "fb": Answer-set expanded by utilizing the Freebase knowledge base.
  "wiki": Answer-set expanded by utilizing the Wikipedia. Only available for TriviaQA.
  "entity_expand": Answer-set expanded by our Entity-driven Answer-set Expansion.
```

  Here is an example of a data point:
```json
{
'question': 'who got the first nobel prize in physics',
 'golden_answer': ['Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen'],
 'answer_fid': 'Wilhelm Röntgen',
 'judge_fid': True,
 'answer_gpt35': 'The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Wilhelm Röntgen in 1901.',
 'judge_gpt35': True,
 'answer_chatgpt': 'The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Röntgen for his discovery of X-rays.',
 'judge_chatgpt': True,
 'answer_gpt4': 'The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, a German physicist. He received the prize for his discovery of X-rays, a groundbreaking achievement that revolutionized the fields of medicine, physics, and chemistry.',
 'judge_gpt4': True,
 'answer_newbing': 'According to Wikipedia, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen of Germany got the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery of X-rays.  He received 150,782 SEK (Swedish krona) as the prize money.',
 'judge_newbing': True,
 'ans_type': 'PERSON',
 'fb': ['Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen', 'wilhelm conrad röntgen'],
 'entity_expand': ['Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen',
  'Conrad Röntgen',
  'Wilhelm Röntgen',
  'Röntgen',
  'Wilhelm C. Röntgen']
